Key features of C#:
1. C# is an Object-Oriented Language**
 This means that development is easier if there are long codes in large projects as compared to procedure-oriented programming languages.
2. Structured programming language**
The programs in C# can be structured by breaking them into smaller parts using functions. This makes the program easier to understand.
3. Simple to use**
It is quite simple to use C# as it has various features and functionalities. Moreover, it provides a structured approach that makes the program easier to understand.
4. Scalable language**
